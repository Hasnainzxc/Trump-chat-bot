Chat to Kanye currently uses two public APIs and a handful of string arrays to create a response to your message.

## How to interact with Kanye

- Kanye will greet you by using simple keywords like "hey", "hello", etc. e.g: "Sup Kanye"
- You can part ways with Kanye by using keywords like "bye", "goodbye", "cya" e.g: "Later Kanye!"
- Kanye will give you the time by using the keyword "time" e.g: "What time is it Kanye?"
- Ask Kanye his birthday by using keyword "birthday", "age" e.g: "When is your birthday?"
- Kanye can tell you your fortune, but using the "fortune" keyword, e.g: "Hey kanye, whats my fortune?"
- If you'd like to ask Kanye about his now ex-wife Kim Kardashian, use keywords "Kim" or "Kardashian" e.g: "Hows Kim yeezy?"
- If you'd like Kanye to provide you with some food ideas, simply ask him about "chicken", "rice" or many other key words and he will provide you with a random recipe for the included keyword e.g: "Kanye I want some tacos". This is done by using the MealDB API.
- Kanye will provide you with one of his memorable quotes by typing anything in the textbox that doesnt include many of the key words provided. This is done by using the kanye.rest API.
