The Trump Chatbot project is an open-source conversational bot that simulates interactions with Donald Trump. It uses various APIs and predefined responses to engage with users.

## How to Interact with Trump

- Start the conversation with a greeting such as "hi," "hello," or "yo," for example, "Hello, Trump!"
- Say goodbye with keywords like "bye," "goodbye," or "cya," for instance, "Goodbye, Trump!"
- Ask Trump for the current time using the word "time," like "What time is it, Trump?"
- Inquire about Trump's birthday or age by using "birthday" or "age," such as "When is your birthday, Trump?"
- Seek a fortune by mentioning "fortune," for example, "Hey Trump, what's my fortune?"
- If you'd like to inquire about Melania or the Trump family, use keywords like "Melania," "Trump," "Kardashian," or "Kim," e.g., "How's Melania, Trump?"
- If you're looking for food suggestions, mention food items like "chicken," "rice," or other keywords, and Trump will provide you with a random recipe using the MealDB API. For instance, "Trump, I want some tacos."
- When you ask something that doesn't match the predefined keywords, Trump will respond with one of his memorable quotes, using the kanye.rest API.

## How to Contribute

- Add new responses to increase the variety of Trump's answers.
- Integrate new APIs to expand the range of questions and responses.
- Ensure the Food API works seamlessly with the Trump Rest API.
- Implement a "..." animation between messages.
- Integrate the Twitter API to fetch Trump's tweets.
- Add a feature where Trump sends a virtual selfie.
- Use the Fisher-Yates algorithm to prevent repetitive responses.
